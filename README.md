# CS-300-Data-Structures-Algorithms

 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    One of the main challenges I encountered during the course was understanding how to effectively use pointers. While the concept of pointers isn't overly complicated in isolation,       incorporating them into data structures like vectors or binary search trees (BSTs) introduced a higher level of complexity that took time to grasp.
    
 How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   To improve my understanding, I made a point of reviewing my study notes and course materials regularly, especially the sections focusing on pointers and how they relate to different data structures. I also supplemented my learning with online tutorials and videos, which helped reinforce the concepts and showed practical examples in use.
   
 How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   When I hit roadblocks, I turned to my notes and broke problems down step by step to think through the logic. Additionally, I utilized tutoring services to gain further clarification on complex concepts, which proved extremely helpful in solidifying my understanding.
   
 How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   This course introduced me to a more advanced coding environment and pushed me to engage with complex data structures like vectors and BSTs on a deeper level. As a result, I gained a stronger understanding of how these structures work behind the scenes and improved my ability to implement them effectively in my programs. It also reinforced essential concepts like function prototypes, loops, and the overall structure of a well-designed program.
   
 How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Working through these projects has changed the way I approach writing code. I've become more conscious of using clear comments, consistent indentation, and organized formatting to ensure that my programs are easier for others (and my future self) to read and maintain. This focus on clarity and structure has made my code more adaptable and professional.
